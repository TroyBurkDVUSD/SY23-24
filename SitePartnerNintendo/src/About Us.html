        Nintendo and all the experiences it's given us will always live in my and my partners soul. Since we were young kids in the south side of Florida, me and my best friend, Bryant, have been obsessed with our NES and Gamecube. My favorite was Kirby, and his favorite was The Legend of Zelda. What was both of our favorites though, was sharing the awesome experience of playing those games with the entire neighborhood. All the neighborhood kids, from the poor to the rich, bonded together over the terrifying trials, the awe-inducing sights, and the obstacles which sometimes we thought would never overcome. Of course, you can't play games forever and you have to grow up eventually. However later in life, freshly graduated from college, which was not all it was cracked up to be, my partner and I finally got together after 6 years over some beers and the original Legend of Zelda. We reminisced about the time we spent bonding over our games and that's when it collectively hit us both what our real paths were. Like after trudging in the dank dungeon for years, we've finally found the ancient treasure with a satisfying jingle. We wanted everyone in the world to have the same life defining experience of Nintendo games,and so we thought the best way to do so was to make our own website. Twenty years later, accomplishing our mission everyday, I feel that this was the right choice.
