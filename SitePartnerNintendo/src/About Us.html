        <h1>About Us</h1>
    </div>
    <p>As children, videogames would always fascinate us. Their wide array of colors and sounds and musics had our attention in a chokehold. We would always stay up late at night in order to play our small collection on the NES, including Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda, Tetris, and of course, the orginal Mario Bros. This fascination has stopped as we grew, instead we always made sure to gather the new consoles as they slowly released, and gather a huge collection of games. However, as we grew older, the newer consoles started to evolve out of our style, and didn't buy any of them. While we were scrolling through Craigslist, we saw many used consoles on sale being unused. These were consoles that we grew on, and we hated to see them be trashed by others. That was when we decided we would start an exporting company for used consoles. Instead of letting them go to waste, why not find another person who would love to have, and give those consoles a little more life. That is how Nintemple was made</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to help stop the waste of perectly good consoles and distrubute them to others who want them. Recycling also helps reduce our carbon footprint we as humans make, so this is another pro.</p>
