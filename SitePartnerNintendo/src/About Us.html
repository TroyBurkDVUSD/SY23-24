        Nintendo and all the experiences its given us will always live in my and my partners soul. Since we were young kids in the south side of Florida,
        me and my best friend Bryant were obsessed with our NES and Gamecube. My favorite was Kirby, and his favorite was Legend of Zelda. What was both of our favorites though, were the
        terrifying trials, the awe - inducing sights, and the triumphs which sometimes we thought would never overcome. Of course, you can't play games forever and you've gotta do adult things.
        was sharing the awesome experience of playing those games with the entire neighborhood. All the neighborhood kids, the poor and rich ones, bonded together over the
        However later in life, freshly graduated from college, which was not all it was cracked up to be, me and my partner finally got together after 6 years over some beers and Legend of Zelda.
        We reminisced about the time we spent bonding over our games and that's when it collectively hit us both what our real paths were. Like after trudging in the dank dungeon for years, we've finally found the ancient treasure with a satisfying jingle.
        We wanted everyone in the world to have the same life defining experience of Nintendo games,and so we thought the best way to do so was to make our own website.
        20 years later, accomplishing our mission everyday, I feel that this was the right choice.

    <p class="page-2 bulk">Our mission is to share the joy we felt during our time shared playing games, while also recycling unwanted consoles and give it to the ones who do want them. This is one step to the path of being very mindeful of our waste which not many people are aware of today.</p>
